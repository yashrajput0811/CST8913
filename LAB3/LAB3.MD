# Cloud Migration Plan for Retail Company

## Overview
This document outlines the migration strategies for moving a mid-sized retail company's infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. Each component is analyzed and a specific cloud service (PaaS, IaaS, or SaaS) is recommended based on the operational requirements.

## Migration Strategies

### 1. Web Application Migration
- **Current State:** Monolithic application hosted on physical servers
- **Cloud Migration Target:** PaaS (AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, Google App Engine)
- **Migration Strategy:** Refactor
- **Key Steps:**
  1. Assess the application for cloud readiness
  2. Break down the monolithic architecture into microservices, if feasible
  3. Deploy to PaaS environment
  4. Configure auto-scaling and load balancing for high availability

### 2. SQL Database Migration
- **Current State:** Hosted on-premises on SQL Server
- **Cloud Migration Target:** 
  - Initial: IaaS (AWS EC2, Azure VM)
  - Long-term: PaaS (AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud SQL)
- **Migration Strategy:** Lift and Shift to IaaS, followed by Refactor for PaaS
- **Key Steps:**
  1. Migrate database to a cloud-based VM
  2. Implement cloud-native database backup solutions
  3. Ensure backup and recovery options are in place
  4. Once stable, transition to a fully managed cloud database service (DBaaS)

### 3. File Storage Migration
- **Current State:** Local file system or NAS
- **Cloud Migration Target:** PaaS (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage)
- **Migration Strategy:** Rehost
- **Key Steps:**
  1. Migrate files to cloud storage
  2. Implement access control and security through IAM
  3. Configure lifecycle management to optimize storage costs and retention policies

### 4. Networking Migration
- **Current State:** Local routers, firewalls, and load balancers
- **Cloud Migration Target:** Cloud-native networking (AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network, Google Virtual Private Cloud)
- **Migration Strategy:** Rebuild
- **Key Steps:**
  1. Design and implement a cloud-based networking infrastructure
  2. Configure security groups, load balancers, and VPNs for secure communication
  3. Set up a hybrid network if necessary for gradual migration
  4. Monitor and optimize performance

### 5. Email Service Migration
- **Current State:** Local SMTP server
- **Cloud Migration Target:** SaaS (AWS SES, SendGrid, Microsoft 365)
- **Migration Strategy:** Replace
- **Key Steps:**
  1. Migrate email sending processes to a cloud-based email provider
  2. Integrate the web application with the new SaaS email service for client notifications
  3. Ensure proper email delivery and logging
  4. Test and monitor the new service

## Conclusion
This migration plan leverages cloud services to modernize the company's infrastructure, making it more scalable, cost-efficient, and easier to manage. The phased approach allows for gradual transition and minimizes disruption to ongoing operations.
